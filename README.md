# RPG.py
A text-based interactive RPG game in Python

This game is a practical and fun way for me to practice the little I know of Python.
It is also a oportunity for me to practice how to use Github!

All feedback is gratelly apreciated and welcome! Feel free to help me improve and help the game to evolve! 


This is still a VERY early version of I want this game to be. There are several features I want to implement but either I didn't have time yet or I will need to study a little more to make it happen! 

Thank you for visiting and Welcome to RPG.py!!
